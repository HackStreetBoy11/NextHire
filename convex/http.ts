// ðŸ”¹ What happens in your HTTP page
// Clerk User Signs Up
// The user goes to your app and clicks Sign Up or is redirected to Clerkâ€™s SignIn/SignUp page.
// Clerk Fires user.created Event
// When the user completes signup, Clerk triggers a webhook: user.created.
// Clerk sends this event to your HTTP endpoint /clerk-webhook.
// Webhook Receives the Event
// Your Convex HTTP router (http.route) receives the POST request.
// It first verifies the webhook signature using svix to make sure the request is legitimate.
// Extract User Data
// From the webhook payload, you get:
// id â†’ Clerk user ID
// email_addresses â†’ user email
// first_name and last_name
// image_url â†’ avatar
// You format this into your Convex-friendly structure (name, email, etc.).
// Sync User into Convex
// Calls ctx.runMutation(api.users.syncUser, { clerkId, email, name, image })
// This inserts the user into your Convex database, so now your app has a local record of the user.
// User Is Ready
// The next time the user logs into your app, their data is already in Convex.
// This allows all other modules (like interviews, comments) to link to this user.
